                <div class="abouttext">
                  <p class="aboutp">I was born in India, grew up in the Middle East, and immigrated to the United States at the age of eleven. Growing up in three countries taught me to appreciate the diversity of the human experience, but more importantly, helped me understand that deep down inside, many of us want the same things - safety, love, affirmation, and happiness.</p>
                  <p>Following my graduation from Arizona State University in May 2007, I entered the field of mental health with a desire to work in spaces as diverse as the people I intended to help. I began my journey with an internship in private practice, where I developed the skills necessary to treat a wide variety of mood and trauma disorders.</p>
                  <p>I graduated with a Masters Degree in Professional Counseling in May 2012 and spent the next four years working with Native American families on the San Carlos Apache Reservation. My time on the reservation was equal parts rewarding and formative, and it solidified my desire to work with individuals and families who have often been historically overlooked or mistreated in healthcare spaces.</p>
                  <p>Upon moving to Atlanta in 2016, I began my ongoing work with members of local LGBTQ+ communities of color. I also returned to private practice at this time and began my work in daytime television. I was extensively involved with Divorce Court in on and off-camera capacities for several seasons before setting out to found a private practice of my own. </p>
                  <p>The formation of Garuda Counseling is, in many ways, a culmination of my experiences as both a person and as a professional. I am excited to work with individuals for all walks of life, but my passion remains working alongside those who have felt unseen or unheard in traditional counseling spaces. <a href="#schedule">Let’s talk soon</a> - I know we can accomplish great things together. </p>

                    <p>Trauma can take many forms, and often has a way of altering our lives, our relationships, and even our physical health. Confronting past trauma can be frightening, especially when trying to do so alone. </p>

                    <p>Do you feel internal conflict from your own identities in addition to the external conflict from a society that was not built for you? Is the chasm between your cultural heritage and mainstream American society threatening to swallow you? Navigating the pressures of growing up differently – in an immigrant household, in a strict religious sect, or as a racial/sexual minority – can contribute to anxiety and depression, and make the outside world much harder to handle.</p>
                    <p>I cannot change how the world treats you, but I can provide guidance to help you respond to the outside world with inner strength and calm. Together, we can navigate the anxiety, depression, or trauma holding you back from living as the person you want to be.

                <div class="collapsible-content">
                    <p> I do have a limited amount of discounted and pro-bono sessions available for uninsured Georgia residents who are members of certain marginalized groups. If you are in need of reduced-cost or pro-bono services, I would be happy to discuss the specifics of your case during our initial consultation meeting. </p>
                </div>
                <button type="button" class="collapsible">Do you offer services at non-traditional hours (nights, weekends, etc.)?</button>
                <div class="collapsible-content">
                    <p>Yes, I do have a limited number of after-hours slots available. Please be aware that these slots do cost more than sessions during traditional hours ($150 per individual session, $210 per couples session), and are not covered by insurance.  </p>
                </div>
                <button type="button" class="collapsible">Do you write accommodation letters for clients?</button>
                <div class="collapsible-content">
                    <p>Yes, I am willing to write accommodation letters for clients following the receipt of a signed release of information form. Letter writing requests will be billed at the same rate as an individual counseling session ($120 per hour).</p>

                <div class="collapsible-content">
                    <p>Unfortunately not. Based on the rules governing my license, I will not be able to provide you with services if you are not physically present in Georgia or Florida at the time of our meeting. </p>

                <button type="button" class="collapsible">What is your cancellation policy?</button>

                    <p>Clients may cancel their appointments at no cost up to twenty-four hours before the scheduled start time of their session. Sessions that are canceled with less than twenty-four hours notice will incur fees of $120 (individual sessions) and $180 (couples sessions.) </p>
